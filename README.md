# SQL-Movie-Store
Extended upon a college project, incorporates Python with creating a basic SQL database. This project using OracleSQL.

## Disclaimer
This project is a college project to learn SQL. I will not specify the class or too many project details, plus I'm expanding on it more than the original project called for anyway. The dataset contains IMDB data on movie titles, actors and directors. The "Movie Store" is not real, all data should be considered fake and is only used for building the SQL database. 

Feel free to use anything in this repository as a reference only. Don't copy and paste this to your school project, I'm sure there's plenty to improve upon.

## Purpose
The original project only required us to create the SQL files, but I wanted to take the opportunity to incorporate Python and increase the size to make it a better portfolio piece.

## Entity-Relation Diagram
The ERD is not pretty (we were required to use a specific school program to create it) but it was part of the previous project that builds to this one. Some parts are going to be changed to make more sense, but this was only made to demonstrate the concept to fulfill the requirement.

This ERD will NOT get updated once this portfolio piece is completed.
